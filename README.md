- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we're @Helprosoftware team
The software uploaded on this github is under the gpl licence which vaguely means it can be used and edited by anyone but the gpl licence still remains on whatever you produce from it
We believe in open source and this is why we did it this way
the code is very messy so pls don't make fun of it as it was nice of us to upload anything at all
the website will soon be uploaded at :
please enjoy this website as much as possible and give it the use you wish.
Programmed with Python Django
